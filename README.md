# Watermarking Techniques

This project implements various watermarking techniques in Python, including LSB, DCT, and DWT-SVD methods. The project demonstrates how to embed and extract watermarks from images using these techniques.

## Requirements

To install the required libraries, run:

```sh
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- `src/Visible_watermark_multi.py`: Contains the implementation for adding visible watermarks to images.
- `src/dwtsvd.py`: Contains the implementation of the DWT-SVD watermarking technique.
- `src/LSB%20and%20DCT.py`: Contains the implementation of the LSB and DCT watermarking techniques.
- `src/requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries.

## Usage

### Visible Watermarking

To add visible watermarks to an image, run the following script:

```sh
python src/Visible_watermark_multi.py
```

### DWT-SVD Watermarking

To embed and extract watermarks using the DWT-SVD technique, run the following script:

```sh
python src/dwtsvd.py
```

### LSB and DCT Watermarking

To embed and extract watermarks using the LSB and DCT techniques, run the following script:

```sh
python src/LSB%20and%20DCT.py
```
